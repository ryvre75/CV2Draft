          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>I have been interested in technology since I was 8, when my aunt bought me my first computer, disassembled it, and had me put it back together. Since then, I picked up coding through highschool course and kept up during college as well. I now work as an Associate Support Engineer, making my way towards Front End Developer with each passing day.</p>

            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>I often meet with stakeholders, management, and consumers. I have mastered analyzing their issues, finding the root of the problem, and resolving it in a timely manner. In addition, I have worked with several different teams, and orgs in order to bring about change in the company. I am used to consistently learning new things and implementing them and my everyday workflow. </p>
